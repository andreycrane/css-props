# opacity

The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.

## Values

<dl>
<dt>&lt;alpha-value&gt;</dt>
<dd>A &lt;number&gt; in the range 0.0 to 1.0, inclusive, or a &lt;percentage&gt; in the range 0% to 100%, inclusive, representing the opacity of the channel (that is, the value of its alpha channel). Any value outside the interval, though valid, is clamped to the nearest limit in the range.</dd>
</dl>

## Examples

```
opacity="0.2" /* Barely see the text over the background */
opacity="0.5" /* See the text more clearly over the background */
opacity="0.9" /* See the text very clearly over the background */
```
