## text-transform

The text-transform CSS property specifies how to capitalize an element's text. It can be used to make text appear in all-uppercase or all-lowercase, or with each word capitalized. It also can help improve legibility for ruby.


## Values

uppercase
Is a keyword that converts all characters to uppercase.

lowercase
Is a keyword that converts all characters to lowercase.

none
Is a keyword that prevents the case of all characters from being changed.

full-width
Is a keyword that forces the writing of a character — mainly ideograms and Latin scripts — inside a square, allowing them to be aligned in the usual East Asian scripts (like Chinese or Japanese).

full-size-kana
Generally used for <ruby> annotation text, the keyword converts all small Kana characters to the equivalent full-size Kana, to compensate for legibility issues at the small font sizes typically used in ruby.
