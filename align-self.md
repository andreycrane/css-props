# align-self

The align-self CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items value. In Grid, it aligns the item inside the grid area. In Flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross axis.


## Values

<dl>
<dt>auto</dt>
 <dd>Computes to the parent's align-items value.</dd>

<dt>normal</dt>
 <dd>The effect of this keyword is dependent of the layout mode we are in:
In absolutely-positioned layouts, the keyword behaves like start on replaced absolutely-positioned boxes, and as stretch on all other absolutely-positioned boxes.
In static position of absolutely-positioned layouts, the keyword behaves as stretch.
For flex items, the keyword behaves as stretch.
For grid items, this keyword leads to a behavior similar to the one of stretch, except for boxes with an aspect ratio or an intrinsic sizes where it behaves like start.
The property doesn't apply to block-level boxes, and to table cells.</dd>

<dt>self-start</dt>
<dd>Aligns the items to be flush with the edge of the alignment container corresponding to the item's start side in the cross axis.</dd>

<dt>self-end</dt>
 <dd>Aligns the items to be flush with the edge of the alignment container corresponding to the item's end side in the cross axis.</dd>

<dt>flex-start</dt>
 <dd>The cross-start margin edge of the flex item is flushed with the cross-start edge of the line.</dd>

<dt>flex-end</dt>
 <dd>The cross-end margin edge of the flex item is flushed with the cross-end edge of the line.</dd>

<dt>center</dt>
 <dd>The flex item's margin box is centered within the line on the cross-axis. If the cross-size of the item is larger than the flex container, it will overflow equally in both directions.</dd>

<dt>baseline, first baseline, last baseline</dt>
 <dd>Specifies participation in first- or last-baseline alignment: aligns the alignment baseline of the boxâ€™s first or last baseline set with the corresponding baseline in the shared first or last baseline set of all the boxes in its baseline-sharing group.
The fallback alignment for first baseline is start, the one for last baseline is end.</dd>

<dt>stretch</dt>
 <dd>If the combined size of the items along the cross axis is less than the size of the alignment container and the item is auto-sized, its size is increased equally (not proportionally), while still respecting the constraints imposed by max-height/max-width (or equivalent functionality), so that the combined size of all auto-sized items exactly fills the alignment container along the cross axis.</dd>

<dt>safe</dt>
 <dd>If the size of the item overflows the alignment container, the item is instead aligned as if the alignment mode were start.</dd>

<dt>unsafe</dt>
 <dd>Regardless of the relative sizes of the item and alignment container, the given alignment value is honored.</dd>
</dl>

## Examples

```
align-self="center" /* Put the item around the center */
align-self=start" /* Put the item at the start */
align-self="end" /* Put the item at the end */
align-self="self-start" /* Align the item flush at the start */
```
