# grid-template-areas

The grid-template-areas CSS property specifies named grid areas, establishing the cells in the grid and assigning them names.

## Values

<dl>
<dt>none</dt>
<dd>The grid container doesnâ€™t define any named grid areas.</dd>
<dt>&lt;string&gt;+</dt>
<dd>A row is created for every separate string listed, and a column is created for each cell in the string. Multiple named cell tokens within and between rows create a single named grid area that spans the corresponding grid cells. Unless those cells form a rectangle, the declaration is invalid.</dd>
</dl>

## Examples

```
grid-template-areas="none"
grid-template-areas=""a b""
grid-template-areas=""a b b"
                     "a c d""
```
