# white-space

The white-space CSS property sets how white space inside an element is handled.

## Values

<dl>
<dt>normal</dt>
<dd>Sequences of white space are collapsed. Newline characters in the source are handled the same as other white space. Lines are broken as necessary to fill line boxes.</dd>
<dt>nowrap</dt>
<dd>Collapses white space as for normal, but suppresses line breaks (text wrapping) within the source.</dd>
<dt>pre</dt>
<dd>Sequences of white space are preserved. Lines are only broken at newline characters in the source and at &lt;br&gt; elements.</dd>
<dt>pre-wrap</dt>
<dd>Sequences of white space are preserved. Lines are broken at newline characters, at &lt;br&gt;, and as necessary to fill line boxes.</dd>
<dt>pre-line</dt>
<dd>Sequences of white space are collapsed. Lines are broken at newline characters, at &lt;br&gt;, and as necessary to fill line boxes.</dd>
<dt>break-spaces</dt>
<dd>The behavior is identical to that of pre-wrap, except that:
Any sequence of preserved white space always takes up space, including at the end of the line.
A line breaking opportunity exists after every preserved white space character, including between white space characters.
Such preserved spaces take up space and do not hang, and thus affect the boxâ€™s intrinsic sizes (min-content size and max-content size).</dd>
</dl>

## Examples

```
white-space="pre-wrap"
white-space="pre"
white-space="normal"
