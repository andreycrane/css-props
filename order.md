The order CSS property sets the order to lay out an item in a flex or grid container. Items in a container are sorted by ascending order value and then by their source code order.

## Values

<dt>&lt;integer&gt;</dt>
<dd>Represents the ordinal group to be used by the item.</dd>
</dl>

## Examples

```
order="5"
order="-5"
order="inherit"
order="initial"
```
